To Do List (In no order):


- Give a simple formula to adjust your ratios based on local humidity and air pressure
- State local conditions and personally observed densities relative to the average of multiple internet sources





Nick's Thoughts on Workflow:

- Data scrape 100 recipes, citing and recording their contents for the ingredients. Include an occurance count for each ingredient, and modify dataframe to consolidate things like "egg" vs "eggs."
- Include prep steps and baking time/temps
- Observe the most common ingredients, and manually create an accurate dictionary containing densities for all items that will be included in the median meal
- Calculate the actual contents of each recipe into mass amounts for accurate statistical analysis
- Normalize all quantities by total recipe weight for breakdown bar plot

To remove:

- Exclude common name conversions like "granulated sugar to white sugar" since the text parsing will probably be wrong a bunch; I percieve this step to be tedious and not worth the effort, and this may just complicate things. Scripts CAN do this, but I feel as if a human in the loop might just be less effort.
- Exclude ChatGPT from the process, since its unreliable for accurate data. It reports on what it has, and if it doesn't have it, it makes it up.
